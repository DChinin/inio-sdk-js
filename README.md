Inio.TV JavaScript SDK
===========

This repo is a part of the Inio.TV application, see http://www.inio.tv/ for more details.


### Quick Start
All application files are located in the `/application` directory. Modify `app.js` and `/application/view/scene/home.js` files.

By default, `home.js` uses a Mustache template. Templates are located in the `/template` directory.

When you add a new scene, you must include a script tag to the `index.html` in the `<!-- Application -->` section
